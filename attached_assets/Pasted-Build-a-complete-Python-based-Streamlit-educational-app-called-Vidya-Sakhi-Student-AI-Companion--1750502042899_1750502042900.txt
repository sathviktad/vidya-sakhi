Build a complete Python-based Streamlit educational app called *Vidya Sakhi – Student AI Companion* designed for Indian school students (Classes 3 to 12). The app must run entirely within *Streamlit, be visually neat and responsive, and must use only **free libraries* (no paid APIs or paymets required). Include the following fully working features: 

MULTILINGUAL CHATBOT: 
- Use a free local chatbot logic or placeholder (no paid OpenAI or any paid API). 
- Let the user select a language (from Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Urdu).
- Use translatepy to translate user input from the selected language into English.
- Use a placeholder chatbot logic (like a basic AI or rule-based reply system).
- Translate the reply back into the selected language using translatepy.
- Display both the original and translated chat.
- Allow continuous conversation with *Enter key* and *Ask Sakhi button*.
- Provide *voice output* for each reply using **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).

STUDY MATERIALS SECTION: 
- Add a section with subject-wise study notes and PDFs (can use dummy files to dmonstrate). 
- Subjects: Math, Science, Social, English, Hindi, GK, Value Education, Computers. 
- Use collapsible sections per subject.
- Make the PDFs downloadable (sample dummy files allowed).

QUIZ MODULE: 
- Support classes 3 to 12.
- Subjects classes 3-5: Math, Science, Social, English, GK, Computers, Sports, Value Education, Regional Language. 
- Split Science into Physics/Chemistry/Bio from class 8 and Social into History/Geography/Civics from class 6 onward. 
- 11th and 12th should be stream based. i.e; MPC, BiPC, etc
- Quiz must work without downloading or paid APIs.
- Show MCQ (A, B, C, D) one by one with answer check.
- Display correct/incorrect feedback and final score with a result screen. 
- Keep increasing the difficulty level as the class increases, 11th and 12th are expected competative exams level, 9th and 10th are expected board level difficulty and so onn.

- Questions must be generated in the selected regional language using translatepy (from base English).

VOICE FEATURES: 
- Use gTTS to read:
  - Chatbot replies
  - Quiz questions (optional)
- Add a mute/unmute voice toggle in the sidebar.

UI AND LAYOUT: 
- Use Streamlit layout with unsafe_allow_html=True for enhanced design.
- Stunning, professional student-friendly layout. 
- Add dark/light theme toggle.
- Sidebar:
  - Class selection
  - Language selection
  - Theme toggle
- Display a cute assistant image or avatar as it is for the students. 
- All features must be displayed on a beautiful layout as you prefer (chat and quiz side by side if possible). 
- Include a friendly header like: "Vidya Sakhi – Your Learning Bestie" or a good one. 

NOTE: 
- No paid services (no OpenAI, no DeepSeek, no Firebase, no external hosting).
- Everything should run locally or on free Streamlit hosting.
- Use placeholder logic where necessary but make sure UI and flow are ready.
- Only use free Python libraries mostly reinstalled or are already satisfied. 

Now generate the full working Streamlit app code accordingly, split into clean files if needed (or one long file). Include fallback messages if a translation fails. Everything should run for free, be child-safe, and multilingual.
Remember free, as I am making it on eductaional purposes!!
Ask me for the footer section when ready and is fully working, so that i will provide the necessary details accordingly.
